## What Was Fixed

### 1. Text Color Updates

#### Before:
- Used hardcoded colors: `#1a1a1c`, `#4a4a52`
- Inconsistent color application
- No dark mode support for some text

#### After:
- All text now uses semantic color tokens:
  - `var(--text-primary-light)` = `#1C1C1E` (15.8:1 contrast)
  - `var(--text-primary-dark)` = `#FFFFFF` (for dark mode)
  - `var(--text-secondary-light)` = `#48484A` (7.2:1 contrast)
  - `var(--text-secondary-dark)` = `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.82)` (for dark mode)

### 2. Glass Card Overlays

#### Updated:
- Overlay opacity: `0.9` → `1.0` (full opacity)
- Background color: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.85)` → `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.92)`
- Dark mode: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.65)` → `rgba(28, 28, 30, 0.90)`

**Result:** Text is now always clearly readable on glass surfaces

### 3. Hero Video Overlay

#### Updated:
- Background gradient opacity increased
- From `0.95/0.98` → `0.97/0.99`
- Ensures text is readable over video backgrounds

### 4. Specific Sections Fixed

#### Privacy Banner
- Text color: `var(--color-subtext)` → `var(--text-primary-light)`
- Added dark mode support

#### Step Cards
- Text color: `var(--color-subtext)` → `var(--text-secondary-light)`
- Added dark mode support

#### FAQ Items

- Added dark mode support

#### Hero & Section Text
- Text color: hardcoded `#1a1a1c` → `var(--text-primary-light)`
