## 🎬 Video Hero Implementation

### Current Setup
- **Video Element:** `<video>` tag with autoplay, muted, loop
- **Fallback Image:** Uses video-poster.jpg if video fails to load
- **Overlay:** Semi-transparent gradient overlay for text readability
- **Responsive:** Works perfectly on all screen sizes

### How It Works
```
Hero Section (with video)
├── Video wrapper (full screen background)
│   ├── Video element (autoplay, muted, loop)
│   ├── Fallback image (if video not available)
│   └── Overlay (gradient for text readability)
└── Hero content (text and buttons on top)
```

### Video Requirements
When you're ready to add your video:
- **Format:** MP4 (H.264 codec)
- **Resolution:** 1920x1080 (landscape) or 1080x1920 (portrait)
- **File size:** Keep under 10MB if possible
- **Duration:** 10-30 seconds (looping)
- **Filename:** `assets/hero-video.mp4`

### Poster Image Requirements
- **Format:** JPG or PNG
- **Resolution:** Same as video
- **Filename:** `assets/video-poster.jpg`
